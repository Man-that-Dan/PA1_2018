This was a program intended to remove noise from a series of photos and produce one clean photo
or remove an unwanted object from a series of photos.

Problems I encountered:
  This project involved a lot of concepts and functions already covered and written
  in past assignments for this class. I reused some code from previous assignments.
  I had to adapt some functions to fit the prototypes written in the ppm header file.

Thoughts on the assignment:
  I enjoyed this assignment. I liked that it built heavily on code we had
  already written in past assignment. It felt like I was working towards building something
  all along and now I had to put the pieces together and add the finishing pieces. Maybe not finishing,
  I'm sure we will do more ppm images this semester.
